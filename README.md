# neopixel-fire
Display fire effects on a grid of neopixels. [Inspired by Tony at Adafruit](https://www.twitch.tv/adafruit/v/107941601).

Parts I used:
 * [Feather 32u4 AdaLogger](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2795)
 * [NeoPixel FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2945)

I was trying it on a [5V Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501), but somehow bricked it.
